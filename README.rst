**NAME**

::

   OTPCR - Office of the Prosecutor's Communication Rercord 117 of 2019


**SYNOPSIS**

::

    otpcr <cmd> [key=val] [key==val]
    otpcr [-a] [-c] [-d] [-i] [-v]


**DESCRIPTION**

``OTPCR`` holds evidence that king netherlands
is doing a genocide, a written response
where king netherlands confirmed taking note
of “what i have written”, namely proof that
medicine he uses in treatement laws like
zyprexa, haldol, abilify and clozapine are
poison that make impotent, is both physical
(contracted muscles) and mental (make people
hallucinate) torture and kills members of the
victim groups.

``OTPCR`` contains correspondence with the
International Criminal Court, asking for the
arrest of king netherlands, for the genocide
he is committing with his new treatement laws.

Current status is a "no basis to proceed"
judgement of the prosecutor which requires
a "basis to prosecute" to have the king
actually arrested and, thereby, his genocide
stopped.
